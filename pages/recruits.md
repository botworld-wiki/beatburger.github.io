Recruits, how do they work ? They're the most useful tool you have in Botworld Adventure once you know how to handle them: **with love, care, and *watchful supervision***.

**Jobs**: they're all listed in [Jobs](/jobs)

**Squad Cup**: is described in [Arena](/arena)

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-acquisition">

## Acquisition

- 1st : boat lvl 4
- 2nd : boat lvl 7
- 3rd : boat lvl 11

</div>

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-management">

## Management

Unlocked at Boat lvl 7, you can change their bots, abilities and boosters.

Make good use of it?

</div>

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-mechanics">

## Mechanics

Every recruit fight is simulated, so synergies (bots+abilities+boosters) matter. A [good recruit](#tips) can punch above its weight. 

</div>

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-squad">

## Squad Cup

You won't win that one alone!

### Common strats

Distribute your high lvl bots for each recruit to make them equal to enemies

### Tie Breaker

6 bots from you and your recruits fight 6 bots from opponents to define who will win. In tie breaker there will be bots with larger number of remaining health.<br>

[Information worth confirming](</contribute#tbw>)

</div>

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-jobs">

## Jobs

Important revenue stream, some pretty neat rares & epics, and sometimes the easier way to get some annoying [Boat mats](</materials#boat>)<br>

 Recruits is the best way to get coins. There's a lots of job where you can earn 100, 600 or even 2000 if you enough lucky.

Jobs options reset every 6h

Full [Jobs list](</jobs>)

### Tip

if you're waiting for Uberbot, try and pick short jobs so you know you’ll have a chance to pick Uberbot at every reset

</div>

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-reinforcments">

## Reinforcments

### Decoy

1 recruit = 1 less fight. Neat for Bosses/Megas !

### Farming

That's not your job, let them do it for you! <br>

 But make sure you tanking damage from energy guns, or your recruit protection will be way weaker.<br>

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-comp">


## Composition

### “Hard to mess up” objective

Recruits are dumb. It's less about giving them a powerful comp, than it is about giving them tools they won't hurt themselves with.

Don’t think *can this bot/ability do good with this recruit?* but rather *can my recruit use this bot/ability so poorly it doesn’t even help it win a fight ?*

### Avoid: easily-disabled bots

You’ll see a recruit place a [Mort](</mort>) in melee range of a bot, or fail to protect Mort if it’s too close. Placing [Scatter](</scatter>) or [Brute](</brute>) too far away from the fight achieve the same result of doing absolutely nothing.

Any bot that needs a combo or some kind of help from the player (placement, supporting bots or abilities, etc) will do poorly in the hand of a recruit

**Suggested list of Bots to Avoid on your recruits:** [Mort](</mort>), [Brute](</brute>), [Scatter](</scatter>), [Flamer](</flamer>), [Beat](</beat>), [Bigshot](</bigshot>) (without [Stun Immunity](</comps#combos>)), etc...

### Prioritize: self-reliant bots

On the other hand, bots like [Rocketeer](</Rocketeer>) and [Dune Bug](</dune-bug>) are very self-reliant bots, as most [Evaders](</bots#evaders>) and [Splashers](</bots#splashers>) (veto Mort) tend to be. Their **reliable damage, mobility, and effectiveness in hands-off situations** lend them to be more beneficial for recruits to pilot.

**Suggested list of Bots to Prioritize on your recruits:**[Rocketeer](</Rocketeer>), [Dune Bug](</dune-bug>), [Ram](</ram>), [Thump](</thump>), [Fork](</fork>), [Virus](</virus>), [Pluggie](</pluggie>), [Longshot](</longshot>), etc…

### Abilities

The same reasoning applies, give them abilities that require anything like planning ahead and watch them fail miserably.

Ever seen a recruit using [SCT](</sct>) endlessly on [Brute](</brute>) ? I have, that’s fun, but achieve exactly nothing good:

- Brute never gets in range of anything to hit
- Spend every ounce of power available


All of a sudden the fight is **3 bots + botpack** (the opponent) *vs***2 bots + no botpack** (your recruit). Not great.

Thinking of giving your recruit Hasty Ground ? Well here’s hoping it uses it on [KO](</ko>) and not [Bigshot](</bigshot>). etc.

**Avoid abilities that *can easily* be wasted:**[Chaos Translocator](</chaos-translocator>), [Supercharged Chaos Translocator](</supercharged-chaos-translocator>),… [more to add](</contribute#tbw>)

**Prioritize abilities that *will always* have a beneficial outcome:**[Hypercharge](</hypercharge>), Direct damage or Poison, [Shield](</shield>), [Chaos booster](</chaos-booster>)[more to add](</contribute#tbw>)

### Try it out!

The best way to figure out what works and what doesn’t for a recruit comps, is *simply* to just go and **spectate it in action**. Either:

- **Squad Cup:** whenever available. Take notes, maybe even record ?
- **Autobattle:** load up the 4 bots you have in mind for your recruit comp, add 2 lvl 1 bots you have left in your boat, and have a few fights in the wild. It’s not the exact same thing but close enough that you will surely learn a lot, I know I have!


## AI Priorities

The recruits/autobattle AI clearly has favorite bots/abilities and its own priority rules. AI LOVES to use [Hyperdrain](</hyperdrain>), even if ult is on 1% charged.

[Anyone got data on that?](</contribute#tbw>)
