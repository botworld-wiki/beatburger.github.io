# Danger Zones


<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-intro">

**Danger Zones are special zones that require Danger Zone Fuel ![inline block](<https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/923510071026155550/1037817676329930854/icon-dangerzonefuel.png>) to visit. Danger Zones are home to much tougher enemies and bosses as well as better rewards in the form of Danger Chests. The further from the landing spot a chest or enemy is, typically the higher level/tier it will be. Danger Zones are no laughing matter! They're hostile, and Danger Fuel is scarce and precious. Be sure make the most out of every trip!**

### Overview

    **Player (Option A):** I sure am<br>

    **Player (Option B):** What are you doing in the Danger Zone?

- **Bexley (upon picking B):** Just catching my breath. That hill was quite a climb, even for a botmaster as brave and athletic as me.

- **Bexley:** Are you searching for the Danger Zone treasure too?<br>

    **Player (Option A):** Yes<br>

    **Player (Option B):** No, just looking for some ice bot parts<br>

    **Player (Option C):** I already found the treasure

- **Bexley (upon picking A):** Well I must warn you: I am certain to reach the treasure first. So you might as well give up now!<br>

    **Player (Option A):** You're right, I'll turn around and go home.<br>

    **Player (Option B):** You won't beat me sitting around catching your breath all day.<br>

    **Bexley (upon picking A):** That's the spirit! Leave the adventuring to real botmasters like me. Now which suitcase did I pack my mittens in? *(ends encounter)*<br>

    **Bexley (upon picking B):** How dare you! I'll show you who's the bravest botmaster! *(Fight)*

- **Bexley (upon picking B):** A wise choice! A pipsqueak like you wouldn't stand a chance against the bots guarding the treasure anyway.<br>

    **Player (Option B):** Pipsqueak?! We'll see about that. *(Fight)*

- **Bexley (upon picking C):** Pah! Only a bold and fearless botmaster like me could ever reach the summit and find the treasure. You must be mistaken.<br>

    **Player (Option A):** Nope, I found the treasure while you were bravely resting here.<br>

    **Player (Option B):** You're right, maybe it was just some loose scrap someone dropped.<br>

    **Bexley (upon picking A):** How dare you! I'll show you who's the bravest botmaster! *(Fight)*<br>

    **Bexley (upon picking B):** Of course. You wouldn't know the real treasure if you found it. Which you won't, because you're not strong and brilliant like me. *(ends encounter)*



*(upon ending encounter)*

- **Bexley:** Ta ta!

- **Trix:** Dang it! All I've found so far is terrifying wild bots and a pile of treasure and scrap.<br>

    **Player (Option A):** Do you want me to take some of that scrap off your hands?<br>

    **Player (Option B):** I can hold some of that treasure for you if you'd like.

**Player (Option A):** Sure.<br>

- **Flake:** Everyone knows ice abilities are the best, but this buffoon thinks fire abilities are better.

- **Ember:** Obviously fire abilities are better! You can set the whole battlefield on fire.

- **Flake:** But you can stop any bot on its tracks with an ice ability. It's like scissors, paper, rock. Ice beats fire.
