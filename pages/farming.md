# Farming Guide & Routes

To farm Botworld efficiently, you will need:

- **Good recruits**: efficient farming is your [Recruits](/recruits) doing the fighting, while you loot [piles and chests](/loot).
- **Good routes**: different places drop gold at varying amounts, and offer a different selection of [Rare Materials](/materials#rare)
- **Good area knowledge**: As you get to know the precise [spawn location of every potential loot](/maps) and mob for a given area, your performance there will significantly improve. **Especially if your recruits are somewhat lacking**

**Example:**

I don't think you should feel the need to dedicate yourself to farming before lvl 15 at the earliest. I started researching it when I was around lvl 17 myself, and it had been pretty easy to upgrade my main bots just doing the story, contracts & arena.

## Build up your Recruits

- Learn everything about [Recruits](/recruits) and how to build them [good Comps they'll handle respectably](/recruits#composition)
- Since you don't want to fight yourself while farming, don't hesitate to **give them all your best bots** 
- Mobs level increases with yours! Read [Mobs Level Scaling](/exploring#level-scaling), and make sure not to let your Recruits fall too much behind [your own level](/botpack#botpack-level)
- If you're missing good-enough bots, best give up on of your recruits and use it as a decoy, than to have them all be mediocre. 


## Basic Farming Tips

### Relevant Business Upgrades

[Farming-relevant Business Upgrades](/business#for-farming)


### Extra Canisters 

Check out the **far right of the [Shop](/shop#extra-canisters)** (behind ads if you don't have the [Mayoral Membership](/seasons)). 



### Farming Contracts

A [few contracts are not based upon a specific location](/contracts) and can be completed while running most routes:

- Loot X chests / piles
- Fight X bandits / Wild bots
- Disarm X mines

**You can cancel and reroll contracts** that don't fit. It can't be worth your time if you don't have the [Mayoral Membership](/season) that allows you to skip ads though, and even then I don't do it anymore because it's very tedious.

<span class="menu-link-target" id="navigation"></span>

## Route Navigation & Recruit Micro-Managment

- In most routes, you want to **make sure your recruits can deal with the mobs that guard loot or block your way**, while the rest is only optional. This may require some micro-management, usually by not deploying all 3 of them right from the start but keeping them to where they're the most needed.
- Use the **Bombardment gadget (lvl2)** on large groups to help your recruits win fights easier and save up health (thx @birdsound#0152)
- **Tank the energy canons** so it doesn't hurt your recruits instead. 
- Be very careful for them around mines.
Still, if you have such contracts, pick and chose a route that will allow you to complete it.

## Young botmasters

At the early stages of the game, you will be both limited in your route options, and probably not have that great Recruits. **You can still use these techniques**, and will have to make up for your Recruits shortcomings with some **extra micro-management and running to dodge mobs**. Those you can't run, fight many at once.

The loss of gold/min will be made up for by the opportunity to [train any bot](/bots#ai) you want to improve.

[Invisibility](/botpack#gadgets) is a huge help, just as much as the third recruit. 

This route is rich in gold, [Evader Sprays](/evader-spray) and [Splasher Explosives](/splasher-explosives) so you should be able to get a 2nd suitable recruit very soon with upgraded [Evaders](/bots#evaders) and [Splashers](/bots#splashers).

## Best Routes for every Resource

If you haven't yet, you should **read this guide from [the top of the page](#farming-guide--routes)**.

### Mats are Gold

**You will always be looking for gold**, but when you also need specifically some other materials it might be worth it to run an alternative route to have a chance to drop it. **At 475 gold/rare drop**, and \~1 drop/3runs (7min30), it represents **about 63 extra gold/min**. Even just [Sparky Wires](/sparky-wires) make it worth it to have [Wild Bots](/exploring#wild-bots) in your route, even if that decreases your gold earnings. **It's all about compromise**.


### Summary Table

Here are my best routes for Resources I deem "Farmable":

| **Resource** | [Cobblestone Trail](#cobblestone) | [Reef+Bay](#swamp) |  [Monument+Fissure](#desert)| [Redleaf Ridge](#redleaf) | 
| ----------------------------- | ------ | ------- | ---- | ---- | 
| **Gold/min**                  | **35** | **38**  | 26   | 24   |
| **Gold/can**                  | 73     | **109** | 70   | 62   |
| [Evader Spray](/evader-spray) | Lots   | Lots    |      |      |
| [Splasher Explosives](/splasher-explosives) | Lots | Lots | Some | Lots |
| [Tank Plating](/tank-plating) |        |         | Some | **Lots** |
| [Chaser Core](/chaser-core)   |        |         | **Some** |  | 
| [Dull Steel](/dull-steel)     | Lots   | Lots    | Lots | Lots | 
| [Glass Tube](/glass-tube)     | Lots   | Lots    | Some | Some | 
| [Hard Botplates](/hard-botplates) |    |         | Some | Some | 
| [Heavy Steel](/heavy-steel)   |        |         | **Some** |  | 
| [Sticky Goo](/sticky-goo)     | Lots   | Lots    | Some | Lots | 
| [Clear Oil](/clear-oil)       | Lots   | Lots    | Some | Some |
| [Double Cog](/double-cog)     | Lots   | Lots    | Lots | Lots |
| [Rusty Cog](/rusty-cog)       | Lots   | Lots    |      |      |
| [Sparky Wires](/sparky-wires) |        |         | Some | Some |
| [Thick Tube](/thick-tube)     |        |         | Some | **Lots** |
| -                             | -      | -       | -    | -    |
| Routes: | [Cobblestone Trail](#cobblestone) | [Reef+Bay](#swamp) |  [Monument+Fissure](#desert)| [Redleaf Ridge](#redleaf) | 


### Special

Pretty sure there's a good farming route for it all in Spore Wood... [to be researched](/contribute#tbw)

- [Thick Oil](/thick-oil): [Buffalo Bandits](/exploring#bandits)
- [Mini Sensor](/mini-sensor), [Brawler Battery](/brawler-battery): [Critters](/critters)


### Not Farmable

**Botframes:** Read the section about [Finding Botframes](/loot#botframes).

Not saying they can't be found, but I don't see a way to reliably get to a satisfying drop rate per minute for the following:

[Cold Battery](/cold-battery), [Frost Fuel](/frost-fuel), [Hardened Fiberglass](/hardened-fiberglass), [Sputtering Generator](/sputtering-generator), [Jet Fuel](/jet-fuel), [Matte Coating](/matte-coating), [Tangled Wires](/tangled-wires), [Sniper Gyro](/sniper-gyro), [Support Chip](/support-chip)

I suggest you take every opportunity you get to collect them by other means ([Shop](/shop) & [Recruit Jobs](/jobs)).


### What makes a good farming route

- Can drop the type of [Materials](/materials) you're looking for
- Can be **completed by your [Recruits](/recruits)** while fighting as little possible yourself (the goal is 0)
- Doesn't make you run around too much

Experience shows that **the best routes are around 2-4 min/run**, so if you're running for much longer consider trimming it down.

Keep it short, make bank !

A good route will have a high density of [Piles and Chests](/loot), have the desired characteristics for the [Materials](/materials) you're looking for, and usually have more [Bandits](/exploring#bandits) than [Wild Bots](/exploring#wild-bots) since they drop Gold.
