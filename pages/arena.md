- **Gains/Losses:** The higher your absolute ranking, the less you will earn per win, and the more you will lose per loss.


| Ranking Range | 0-1k          | 1k-2k         | 2k-3k         | 3k-4k         | 4k-5k         | 5k+           |

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-brad">

## Brad

Brad is your introduction into the Arena and the owner of the Arena. He won't let you battle the real masters unless you defeat him first.

![300px arenamaster brad](<https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/923510071026155550/927876281767452733/arenamaster-brad.png>)

- **Bots:** [Slicer](</slicer>) and [Chomp](</chomp>) Level 2
- **Abilities:**[Freeze](</freeze>), [Speed Boost](</speed-boost>), [Missile](</missile>), [Chaos Translocator](</chaos-translocator>)
- **Unlocks**: 2 [booster](</botpack#boosters>) slots


### Tips:

- You can't mess this up. just place your strongest bots and be done with it, but make sure you control his [Chomp](</chomp>)

</div>

### Story

- **Brad:** Hi kid, I'm Brad the Arena Manager, you here to get an autograph from one of the arena masters?
- **Player:** Nope, I've come to take them on!
- **Brad:** One cannot simply enter the Arena, you'll have to do a trial to earn your official botpack first. I warn you, it's tough. And I don't think you're ready...
- **Player:** I was born ready. Who do I fight?
- **Brad:** I can conduct a trial for you. All arena masters are different but I prefer a simple 2v2 format, no reserves.
 
 
After you've defeated Brad:

- **Brad:** Well played kid, maybe you really could join a team and become an arena star one day.
- **Brad:** The actual masters will be much tougher than me, but you've definitely earned your new botpack today.
- **Brad:** It's just a white series botpack. which means it only holds two boosters. But if you defeat an arena master they will upgrade it to a green series.
- **Player:** What are boosters?
- **Brad:** Boosters improve different aspects of your botpack or bot team. The booster you have gives you botpack energy right at the start of the battle.


<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-astrid">

## Astrid

Astrid is an arena master who doesn't believe in reserves and likes to deploy all of her 6 bots in the arena preparing for chaos. Nothing but a Chaotic Arena Master

![300px arenamaster astrid](<https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/923510071026155550/927891447682842684/arenamaster-astrid.png>)

</div>

### Story

- **Astrid:** Waaaaaaaaaaaaagh! Watch where you're going little one, I'm gonna stomp you!
 
 
After you've defeated Astrid:

- **Astrid:** Waaaaaaaaa... Hmmpf. I've gotta admit you can handle yourself in a chaotic fight, you deserve this upgrade to a green series botpack.


## Kelvin

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-kelvin">

Kelvin is a cool Arena Botmaster who uses Frost bots and Frost abilities. He also uses a sniper to support his remaining bots. A very cool Arena Botmaster that likes to cool things.

![300px arenamaster kelvin](<https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/923510071026155550/927907161382727700/arenamaster-kelvin.png>)

- [Any more tips we're missing?](</contribute#tbw>)


### Story

After you've defeated Kelvin:

- **Kelvin:** Wow i got melted, I'm just going to go and chill somehwere for a while. Take your blue series botpack and leave me be.

</div>


## Reginald

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-reginald">
Reginald is a dueling master who likes to battle someone with **one bot at a time**. While the rules are simple to fight with, he carries a long-lasting Freeze ability with a stun resistance booster for his bots. A very mean arena master with an attitude.

![300px arenamaster reginald](<https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/923510071026155550/1015727044077826118/Reginald_lv15.png>)

- **Bots:** = [Slicer](</slicer>), [Froggy](</froggy>), [Tether](</tether>), [Scatter](</scatter>), [Longshot](</longshot>), [Brute](</brute>) Level 14
- **Abilities:** [Speed Boost](</speed-boost>), [Chaos Translocator](</chaos-translocator>), [Snowball](</snowball>), [Super Charge](</super-charge>)
- **Unlocks:** 2nd [gadget](</Gadgets>) slot


### Tips

You can **cheese this fight** by using long-lasting abilities like [Corrode](</corrode>), [Unstable Plasma](</unstable-plasma>), [Zap Tower](</zap-tower>), etc. When one of your bots die, the enemy bot will not move until you place your next one, but the time keeps running (while slowed down), which means you'll still generate Botpack Power, [Corrode](</corrode>) will still do damage, the Towers will keep on attacking and abilities like [Unstable Plasma](</unstable-plasma>) will continue charging and eventually blow up.

- Time those abilities well and use them right when your bot is about to die, so that you can just wait for his bot to die before placing your next one.
- This is specially effective to deal with his best 1v1 bots, [Slicer](</slicer>) and [Froggy](</froggy>)
- Always wait until you have 10 Botpack Power before placing your next bot, it'll allow you to dodge his abilities while saving power to use when your current bot is about to die
- Still counter his picks, but save your strongest bots to finish the fight, since you won't be able to cheese your way out entirely<br>

    <br>



If you want to fight fairly, your top priority will be to **avoid the Freeze Balls**. Two ways around it:

- Have a lucky battlefield with obstacles. Can't have that every time, but you will eventually.
- Gave [Chaos Translocator](</chaos-translocator>) at hand and save power to use it in a pinch


[Proximity Translocator](</proximity-translocator>) can be used instead of [Chaos Translocator](</chaos-translocator>) and work considerably better, because you can choose where to teleport your bot.

Then, tip your comp heavily towards **ranged bots so you can kill from afar**. Some [Chasers](</bots#chasers>) are cool, but definetly no tanks.

**Must-have abilities**: [Chaos Translocator](</chaos-translocator>), [Imobilize](</immobilize>), [Proximity translocator](</proximity-translocator>)

**Good to have**: [Gust](</gust>), [Freeze](</freeze>), [Super-Charge](</super-charge>)

- Boosters to help generate power, like [Power Start](</power-start-common>)


The more snipers you have, the better. **Longshot is king and easy to get**, Chomp is so-so but okay. Put them down on the field, keep the enemies away with Imobilize/Gust/Freeze, save 2p for CT to dodge Freeze Ball, and occasionally Overcharge if you can afford it.

Some hidden gems amongst bots:

- **[Rocketeer](</rocketeer>) AI3**: with the knockback effect, it can keep mobs away virtually forever. 100% can easily solo [Brute](</brute>), and then some.
- **[Slicer](</slicer>) AI4**: immune to slow and freeze. Great [Frosty](</frosty>) counter.<br>



[Frosty](</frosty>) counters Reginald’s [Slicer](</slicer>) and [Brute](</brute>), but make sure it to not take too much damage for them or Reginald will place [Froggy](</froggy>) or [Longshot](</longshot>)

### Story

- **Reginald:** You offend me with your lack of skill, there will be barely any honour to be gained with my victory.


After you’ve defeated Reginald:

- **Reginald:** I’m finished, done! How can I ever show my face in this town again? Here’s your red series botpack, may you glow with its magnificence.
</div>

## Jack

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-jack">

An Arena Master whose bots are **all Melees**. While Jack loves to have Melee bots, he will deploy **4 bots at a time**.

![300px arenamaster jack](<https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/923510071026155550/927915632220045332/arenamaster-jack.png>)

- **Bots:** = [Beat](</beat>), [Yanky](</yanky>), [Chainer](</chainer>), [Thump](</thump>), 2x [K.O.](</ko>) Level 17
- **Abilities:** [Hasty Ground](</hasty-ground>), [Charge Field](</charge-field>), [Immobilize Field](</immobilize-field>), [Vortex](</vortex>)
- **Unlocks:** 4th [boostee](</booster>) slot


### Tips

- He seems useless against [Unstable plasma](</unstable-plasma>), [Bombee](</bombee>), [Evaders](</bots#evaders>), and [Splashers](</bots#splashers>)
- Use [Chainer](</chainer>) combos
- [Any more tips we're missing?](</contribute#tbw>)


### Story

- **Jack:** C'mon, let's get into it. I’m gonna thump your bots back into scrap. Don’t even think of running away.


After you’ve defeated Jack:

- **Jack:** Hmmph, you were just out of my reach. Go on, grab a purple series botpack, knock yourself out!

</div>





## Nicola

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-nicola">

A more chaotic Arena Master and that is Nicola. Nicola never runs out of Botpack power. Prepare to fight, prepare to dodge cause this Arena Master will make your battle, filled with chaos.

![300px arenamaster nicola](<https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/923510071026155550/927924538673623070/arenamaster-nicola.png>)

- **Abilities:** [Zap Tower](</zap-tower>), [Charge Bolt](</charge-bolt>), [Firewall](</firewall>), [Unstable Plasma](</unstable-plasma>)
- **Unlocks:** 3rd [gadget](</gadgets>) slot


### Tips

- It's HER or prepare to get nuked ;)
- Try [Chainer](</chainer>) or [Vortex](</vortex>) and group her damage dealers, then use Splashers
- Try to hack her main powers as [Bigshot](</bigshot>), [Pluggies](</pluggie>) and [Pupil](</pupil>).
- Her [Nozzles](</nozzle>) is a big problem, because they have a lots of hp. When your bots are focusing on it, they become vulnerable to [Unstable Plasma](</unstable-plasma>) and [Firewall](</firewall>).
- If she dropped 2 [Nozzles](</nozzle>) at the beggining, you'll lose
- [Any more tips we're missing?](</contribute#tbw>)


### Story

- **Nicola:** Chaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarge me up, haha. Just you wait I'm brimming with power, or don't wait, lets battle right now, I’m wired!


After you’ve defeated Nicola:

- **Nicola:** I’ve never felt so flat, I’m completely drained, gonna take some time out to recharge. I guess this orange series botpack is yours.


### Trivia

She used to spam [Zap Towers](</zap-tower>) like back when that ability was 5p and had a higher rate of fire! Good times...

</div>


## Scales

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-scales">

A monk lizard who strives for balance. **Pairing 2 bots at a time** to make the perfect fighting team (pretty much like Brads but with reserves). Scales don't want your bots to use its ult. whenever your bots escaped from his, he will teleport his bots to yours with an explosive entrance. make sure you choose your bots carefully

![300px arenamaster scales](<https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/923510071026155550/1036021130412171335/Scales.png>)

- **Abilities:** [Supercharged Chaos Translocator](</supercharged-chaos-translocator>), [Explosive Proximity Translocator](</explosive-proximity-translocator>), [Hypercharge](</hypercharge>), [Hyperdrain](</hyperdrain>)


### Tips

- [Virus](</virus>) \+ [Hypercharge](</hypercharge>) = GG only works if he hasnt enough power for [Hyperdrain](</hyperdrain>). Always control his BP power.
- Wedge is knocked out with a wedge, use [Hyperdrain](</hyperdrain>) on his [Virus](</virus>)
- [Any more tips we're missing?](</contribute#tbw>)


### Story

- **Scales** I look forward to our duel, I always enjoy a challenge though I am confident you won't shake me.


After you've defeated Scales:

- **Scales:** I am unsettled... perhaps a new age is dawning. You deserve this prismatic botpack, the most perfectly balanced series that exists.\*Scales:\*\* I am unsettled… perhaps a new age is dawning. You deserve this prismatic botpack, the most perfectly balanced series that exists.

## Laydee

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-laydee">

- [Any more tips we're missing?](</contribute#tbw>)


### Story

- **Laydee:** I hope you don’t stage fright, ‘cause my bots are about to hurl some critique your way!


After you defeated Laydee:

- **Laydee:** Normally I don’t take kindly to being upstaged, but that was a 10/10 performance back there. You deserve this.
