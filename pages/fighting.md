## Basics

You and your opponent place your bots at the same time. The AI doesn't get to see your pick before they make theirs.

## Concepts

### AoE

Area of Effect (AoE) is used any effect that applies to a zone or a group of bots all at once.

### CC

Crowd Control (CC) describes any effect that focuses on giving you a tactical advantage. Like anything that disables or hinders enemy bots or shifts the battleground in your favor: Stun (=freeze), [Gust](/gust), [Vortex](/vortex), [Barrier Wall](/barrier-wall), [Hyperdrain](/hyperdrain)...

### Evasion

Sometimes you need a panic button to get a bot out of trouble right now, so it can keep dealing damage with whatever little HP it has left. [Abilities](/abilities) like: [CT](/chaos-translocator), [Shield](/shield)...

## Use the right Bot for the situation

### Natural counters

Melee to disable Ranged, Ranged to snipe Evaders, Tanks to stall everything, etc.


### Positioning and Targeting

You can't control your bots directly. They'll target the nearest enemy, so everything is about positioning. **You can influence positioning directly** though, first and foremost during Bot placement! Then with abilities.


## Use your Abilities wisely

### Consider Ultimates loads for timing your casting just right

### Budget ahead


## Mechanics

### Poison ticks overlap but don't stack

### Freeze = Stun

### Speed modifiers

Buffs to speed are completely negated once the target gets slowed

### Damage Color Codes

- **Red:** low damage
- **Yellow:** decent damage
- **White:** high/critical damage
- **Green:** lifesteal/regen
- **Lime green:** poison
- **Blue:** blocked/reduced by shield
