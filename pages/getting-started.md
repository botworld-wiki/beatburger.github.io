# Getting Started

## Hello young Botmaster !

If you've just started with this great game and have questions at this very early stage, you're in the right place.


Let's make one thing clear: **this game won't punish you for any choice you make**. Even when mutually exclusive options are presented, you will get other occasions to try and pick the ones you haven't yet, or get the same rewards by other means.


Botworld is well worth exploring at your own pace, and won't punish you for trying stuff or fooling around, so really you can stop reading and go straight in ! 


## Starter bot


It's really just that: your starter bot. **You will find botframes to build the other two** just like any other bot wandering through Botworld. 

You can always check out tier-lists to compare them, but those were made considering end-game strategies and don't necessarily apply to your current situation. By the time they do, you'll surely have had all 3 for quite some time.


## What should I do first ?


You want to **upgrade your boat** to get the sweet business upgrades, and assemble a good comp of bots you like. The story will make both happen, so start with that ! 

As you **wander around in the wilderness**:

- Make sure you have 3 active contracts before leaving town so you can get extra rewards as you go.
- Try and chase the rabbits and other critters, they can also drop scraps !
- Losing a fight will simply make you jetpack back to town
- If you ever find yourself short on canisters, you can get some more from the shop by watching ads.

Whenever you feel ready for a challenge and like trying something new, **make your way to the Arena**: 

- Each Arena Master you beat will give you better botpack, which means more abilities, that's very powerful. 
- Climbing the first ranks of the Solo Arena will reward you with some really cool bots that you should try out.

## What business upgrades should I take ?


It is recommended to start with the machines, their passive generation of scraps, gold, and abilities are really good, especially at your stage of the game !

My personal favorites next are:

- **Repair Boost**: you'll be brought back to town when your canisters are empty, so bigger canisters means more exploration.
- **Risk Reward**: great impact for the cost of a single point.
- **Terrify**: lets you avoid some fights completely, but you still get the rewards ! Big time saver.
- **Contract Master**: if you find yourself doing lots of contracts like I did, extra tokens is great.

But as with everything else, as you upgrade your boat you'll have more energy points to spend and eventually you'll get everything you need.

## How do I get the materials to upgrade my bots ?

Click any material required to upgrade your bot to **get a description of how to get them**. Alternatively, your machines or even the shop might help.

I think that's really all you need to know at this point, so you'd better go and explore Botworld right now !
