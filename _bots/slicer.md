name: "Slicer"
description: "Slicer has the highest DPS in the game (discounting [Slash](/slash)) and has the second-highest burst damage in the game (6208!), just below [Brute](/brute). Unlike [Brute](/brute) however, Slicer doesn't need any setup for his burst and has a respectable 15 mSPD ontop of a gapcloser ability, and he's immune to slows and roots too! He's not all too squishy either, overall a very scary, high-risk high-reward pick for any team.\n\n\n"
