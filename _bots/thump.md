## Comments

### Evaluation by Soft
The bot that stole your lunch money, Thump is the best harasser in the game. He sticks to your squishy bots like crazy, and throws a long-lasting stun tantrum when you try to push him off. Handsdown the best CC bot there is, with respectable damage for a tank as well. Tier B+.

### Tips
- He protects he attacks
