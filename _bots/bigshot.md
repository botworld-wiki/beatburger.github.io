## Comments

### Evaluation by Soft
The big mommy of ranged burst DPS, Bigshot definitely deserves S tier in the lower levels of the game. As the game progresses though, bandits and PvPers alike will have abilities like [Freeze](/Freeze), and Bigshot is a high priority target for the enemy AI with those CC abilities. Since he needs four seconds to charge for every shot, it's doubtful you'll get two shots off before the game ends. Very easily counterable. Tier A.


### Tips
- Equip 2x Epic stun resistance boosters when you use bigshot

### Funfact
- Bigshot was originally a Rare bot back in Early access and got changed into an Epic later on
