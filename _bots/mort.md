### 'Nuke' by BloodxReaper
- **AACAA:** Heavily focused on its ult. 
Best paired with [Ult CD Boosters](/ult-cooldowns-rare) and abilities like [Gust](/gust) to group enemies.

### 'Consistent Dmg' by BloodxReaper
- **ABCAB:** Focused on basic attack. 

## Comments

### Evaluation by Soft
[Brutes](/brute) smaller, long-ranged cousin. Doesn't deal as much damage, but has ranged damage with large splashing. Has a tendency to run away a lot and not know when to stop which infuriates people that use him a lot since he's very slow. Definitely needs a helping hand from a good tank, but performs great when he does. Tier A.

### Tips
- Supercharged First Strike: When Mort is about to launch its Super Shell (Ult), you can hit Mort an ability that boost Mort's damage like [Supercharged Chaos Translocator (SCT)](/supercharged-chaos-translocator) or [Super Charge](/super-charge). See [Combos](/comps#combos)
- Group 'em Up: Bots like [Chainer](/chainer) and [Lobbie](/lobbie) can group the enemies making them a great pair! See [Grouper Comps](/comps#grouper-comp)
- Mort has the highest atk spd of every splasher(?) at 0.78s, so he can dish out more dmg through basic atks than ult if you don't have cdr abilities
- Has the potential to dish out more DMG if you lack [Ult CD Boosters](/ult-cooldowns-rare)  or are using them on [Recruits](/recruits).
