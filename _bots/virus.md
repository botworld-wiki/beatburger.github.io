### Suggested AI Build
- **ABCBA:**

## Comments

### Evaluation by Soft
Virus has been strong ever since he's been introduced and does its job perfectly in any team that he's put in. He has beefy HP and disrupts the enemy team by making them fight eachother through hacking. This also means less damage done on your own team, but when used well with Hypercharge, can completely negate an enemy team's burst and use it against them.

### Evaluation by O.J
Having higher amount of health than usual in exchange of damage output reduction. Virus is considered one of the most viable bots in general.Virus performs extremely good in arena and can be a game changer.

### Tips
- Use 4 [Ult Cooldown boosters](/ult-cooldowns-rare) and it will allow your Virus to have permanent hack even without [Hypercharge](/hypercharge)

### Story: Uberbot
You get Virus from a unique Epic Jobs series (Uberbot)](/jobs#uberbot) that you have to send your [Recruits](/recruits) to.
