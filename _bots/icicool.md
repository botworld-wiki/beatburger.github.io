## 'Evader Build' by Hex 
- **BACAB:** Dodge and Shoot

### 'Sniper Build' by Hex
- **AACBB:** Think of it as a Longshot but it slows every shot it hits, a sniper that slows down enemy from afar. Also slow icicle speed

### 'Hybrid Build' by Hex
- **ABCAA:** A mix build.

## Comments

### Evaluation by Soft
The Tachanka of Botworld, Icicool is ""the meme"" of the botmaster community. On paper, his ability should deal around ~3k damage, if only his spread wasn't three times as worse as [Scatters](/scatter) autoattack. And even if they did all hit, it's still not that amazing of a burst. This doesn't stop people from trying to make him work, though. Tier D.
