### Evaluation by Soft
Unlike other Splashers, Pluggie doesn't have splash damage, but rather damage that bounces with a max range of 4 between 4 enemies. This almost always guarantees hitting at least two, if not three bots with extremely good damage ontop of that, and he also has a baseline bouncing stun with big damage that drains ultimate charge. Tier A+.
