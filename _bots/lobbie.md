## Comments

### Evaluation by Soft
Good in the early game for groupers that don't have better splashers like [Mort](/mort), Lobbie has extremely low HP and no disengage or safety at all. He needs to be babysat by [Chainer](/chainer) or other tanks and even then he turns out to be outclassed by other bots, even most snipers. His vortex is the only thing he has going for him, but Beat does a better job at amplifying your team. Tier C.
