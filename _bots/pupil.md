## Comments

### Evaluation by Soft
Once again looking good on paper, Pupil just doesn't make the cut and is outclassed by [Bigshot](/bigshot) if you want to keep your sniper far away for high damage, [Longshot](/longshot) if you want to risk going close for consistent damage, and [Beat](/beat) if you want to amplify your team damage. His tracking is too slow to keep up with evaders even with the AI speed and his ramp-up takes too long to reach the max. Tier B.
