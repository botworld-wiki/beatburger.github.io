### 'Knockback Build' by Gold
- **ACABA:** Pure knockback build. Good for interrupting bigshot.

### 'Troll Build' by Hex
- **BCAAA:** Build for complete annoyance.

## Comments

### Evaluation by Soft
Rocketeer fills the niche of countering some specific bots with constant knockback CC. [Bigshots](/bigshot) charging gets interrupted by it, [Pupils](/pupil) ramping, those are just examples. He deals respectable damage too and is the only common bot that has three abilities. An absolute fantastic early game bot. Tier B.
