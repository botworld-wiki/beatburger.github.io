### Evaluation by Soft
Recently buffed, Fork fills a niche role where he is currently the best poison-based attacker in Botworld. Good damage, great evasiveness and a fantastic CC ultimate. His poison also bypasses shields like Barrie's barrier, but he has trouble finishing bots off before moving onto an unfortunately bulkier target, allowing his previous target to nuke Fork down from behind. Tier B+.
